Introduction to static libraries in Cprogramming language
A library is a file containing several object files, that can be used as a single entity in a linking phase of a program
Normally the library is indexed, so it is easy to find symbols (functions, variables and so on) in them
Static libraries are just collections of object files that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation, and are not relevant during runtime
